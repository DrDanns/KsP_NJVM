Open file in debug mode:
./njvm --debug <filename>


Operations (they can also be called by typing the first letter):

1. inspect:
	
	1.1. stack:
		Shows the stacks current state.

2. list:
	
	Shows all instructions of the executed file.
	
3. breakpoint:
	
	First this option shows where the breakpoint is set at the moment ("cleared" means there is no breakpoint set).
	Then it expects an input, either a positve integer to set breakpoint at the instruction with this number or "-1" to clear the set breakpoint.
	
4. step:

	Executes next instruction.
	
5. run:

	Executes all instructions until the breakpoint or "halt" is reached.
	
6. quit:

	Closes the debugger and exits the program.
